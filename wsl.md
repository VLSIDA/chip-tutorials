# Windows Subsystem for Linux

The tools we will be using are not supported for Windows. Windows users can install Windows Subsystem for Linus (WSL)
to get the tools working. The instructions for installing WSL can be found here:
[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

Once WSL is installed you can follow the rest of the instructions from the WSL terminal.
