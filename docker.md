# Installing Docker

## Linux (Ubuntu)

To install Docker on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. **Update your existing list of packages**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
   ```

3. **Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key**:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

4. **Add the Docker APT repository**:

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
   ```

5. **Update the package database with the Docker packages from the newly added repo**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

6. **Make sure you are about to install from the Docker repo instead of the default Ubuntu repo**:

   ```bash
   apt-cache policy docker-ce
   ```

7. **Install Docker**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker-ce
   ```

8. **Check that Docker is running**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status docker
   ```

9. **(Optional) Manage Docker as a non-root user**:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
   ```

## Windows

To install Docker Desktop on Windows, follow these steps:

1. **Download Docker Desktop for Windows** from the [official Docker website](https://desktop.docker.com).

2. **Run the Docker Desktop Installer**, which you just downloaded, and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Enable WSL 2** if it is not already enabled:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

     ```powershell
     wsl --install
     ```

4. **Start Docker Desktop** from the Start menu.

5. **Follow the guided onboarding** to build your first container.

6. **Verify installation**:
   - Open PowerShell and run:

     ```powershell
     docker --version
     ```

## MacOS

To install Docker Desktop on MacOS, follow these steps:

1. **Download Docker Desktop for Mac** from the [official Docker website](https://desktop.docker.com).

2. **Open the downloaded Docker.dmg file** and drag Docker to Applications.

3. **Run Docker Desktop** from the Applications folder.

4. **Follow the installation process** and authorize the installer with your system password.

5. **Verify installation**:
   - Open Terminal and run:

     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

6. **Start using Docker** from the Docker menu in the top status bar.

This will set up Docker Desktop on all three platforms: Ubuntu, Windows, and MacOS.

## Check Docker

You can check that Docker is working by running:

```bash
$ docker run -it hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
e6590344b1a5: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:0b6a027b5cf322f09f6706c754e086a232ec1ddba835c8a15c6cb74ef0d43c29
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
